            <p class="flex-content">The name of the reseach was Japanese-American WWII Camps.The goal of the research
                was to create a names
                registry and thesaurus of all the names of the Japanese Americans that where in interment camps during
                WWII. What we had to do was
                connect two datasets that had information about individuals. Issues we faced were that a lot of the data
                was not complete, in addition to
                trying to connect two data sets. The first dataset from
                the start of the internment camps and the second dataset is that of when they were released.</p>

                which requires both tools
                and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human. I spend a lot of time in the
                process of collecting, cleaning,
                and munging data, because data is never clean</p> <!-- basic google definition-->

            <p class="flex-content">Our project consisted of creating a database with either some data we found online
                or made up ourselves. The group
                at the time decide that it be interesting if we created a database about a hospital. We would soon
                realize that finding data on a lot of the
                information is not accessible. Our solution, create as much of the data but at the same time being as
                accurate as possible. </p>
